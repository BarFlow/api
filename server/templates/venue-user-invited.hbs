  BarFlow is a simple yet powerful way to manage a venue's inventory. <br />
  Cut Stock Taking Time by 50% - Stock taking can be done from multiple mobile devices at once, saving time while improving accuracy thanks to our unique and easy to use user interface. <br />
  Minimaze Human Errors - During stocktake, levels are automatically synced to the cloud, no more adding up stock counts manually or inputting data one by one â€“ painless and mistake free workflow. <br />
  Centralized Ordering - With live inventory data, and easy par level adjustments, purchase orders are created with a single click to multiple suppliers at once using the cloud based web dashboard.
